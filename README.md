We shall see how far I will get. :)

## Repo Structure

Each day's challenge has its own directory, `dayN`, which includes an `input.txt` file downloaded from the AoC site, and a .ts file, `dayN.ts` to be run from the command line.

## Running Scripts

Apparently running TS in watch mode for Node with ES6 modules is harder than I expected, so for now you need to manually change the file path to the day you want to run in the `package.json` `scripts` section. Then run `npm run dev` to run the file in watch mode.
